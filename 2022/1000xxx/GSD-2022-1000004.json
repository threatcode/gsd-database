    "description": "The Ethereum @etherwrapped $YEAR Token contained a hidden backdoor. The operator of the contract first called the renounceOwnership() function of the contract and set its new owner to the Uniswap V2 contract address. Thie had the effect of preventing anyone from being able to sell this token on Uniswap V2. This resulted in a rise in the price which triggered various traders to further purchase the token driving the price higher. Approximately 30 minutes after this action started the operator then drained all liquidity from Uniswap V2 netting them approximately 30 ETH (valued at ~100,000 USD at the time of the event). In order to kickstart activity on this contract the operator of the contract had airdropped it to a number of people."
